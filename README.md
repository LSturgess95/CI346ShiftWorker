# CI346ShiftWorker

CI346ShiftWorker/course-api-data/target/course-api-data-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Run above jar in console and then go to localhost:8080

Implemented GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for workers and shifts but no frontend JS only a default HTML page

Only running a derby database, with a class(CI346ShiftWorker/course-api-data/target/classes/io/lukesturgess/workers/DatabaseLoader.class) running to populate two workers on startup

No automated testing, used postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) to test manually
